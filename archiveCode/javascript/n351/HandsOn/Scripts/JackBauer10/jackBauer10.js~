TITLE: Hands on #10 Stringing Jack Bauer Along
AUTHOR: Robert Nathan Boyd (RNB)
CREATE DATE: 2011.07.07
PURPOSE:
	1, Prompts Jack Bauer to enter a text string (between 10 and 15 characters long) and answer a question asking what day of the week it is
	2.Using Jack's entered text string and the day of week, produce a password based on the following criteria
	   a. Monday - password is entered text string converted to all upper case
	   b. Tuesday - password is entered text string converted to all lower case
	   c. Wednesday - Text string position of the first instance of the character 's' ( Password produced will be an integer)
	   d. Thursday - the second character in the string (remember, numbering begins with 0)
	   e. Friday - returns characters starting from first position and including characters up to position 5
	   f.  Saturday - returns characters starting at position 0 and going on for a total length of 3 characters
	   g. Sunday - concatenation of substrings produced on days Friday and Saturday
