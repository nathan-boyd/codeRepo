			<p>It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
				simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the
				smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about
				anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head
				made her look up in a great hurry.</p>

			<h2>Drop Shadow</h2>
			<p>This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
				so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of
				breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
				distance.</p>

            <p>'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;  then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way&mdash;'</p>

			<p>The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round
				her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see
				anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the
				circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about
				the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on
				both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might
				as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p>

			<p>Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
				stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into
				the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed
				at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind
				a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment
				she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the
				stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;
				then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a
				cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its
				feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of
				short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each
				time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till
				at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging
				out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p>
