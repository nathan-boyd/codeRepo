TITLE: Hands on #7 Loopy
AUTHOR: Robert Nathan Boyd (RNB)
CREATE DATE: 2011.07.01
PURPOSE:Create a while loop that asks the user if they want to play a game. Prompt them to answer Yes or No
	If they answer yes, alert them that they are now playing. (Be sure to use a convert to Upper)
	If they answer no, tell them "another time"
	Outside of the loop, (beneath the while), alert a statement that says "You have exited the while"
	The loop should repeat as long as the user answers affirmatively.
