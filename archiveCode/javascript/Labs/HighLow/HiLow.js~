TITLE: Lab #1 High Low
AUTHOR: Robert Nathan Boyd (RNB)
CREATE DATE: 2011.07.03
PURPOSE:Generate a (mostly) random number between 1 - 100. 
	Ask the user if they want to play a game.
	If they say no, ask them to come back some other time
	If they say yes, launch the Hi-Lo game
	Describe the Hi-Lo game to the user 
	Prompt the user for a number
	Compare the user guess to the secret number
	Tell the user whether their guess was Too High, Too low, or correct.
	Keep track of how many tries it takes to guess the number
	ask them if they would like to play again. 
	If they answeryes, 
		re-launch the game. 
		If they say no, thank them for playing and tell them you hope to see them again soon.
	Follow proper coding conventions. (See lab expectations guide)
	Extra credit ie, parameter passing with functions, control structure usage, etc.), as well as artistry of the hosting web page.
