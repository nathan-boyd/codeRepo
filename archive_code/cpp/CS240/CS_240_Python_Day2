CS 240 Python Day 2

There is a differnece between input and raw input
  error causes everyhitng to crash
  exceptions do too but you can catch the exception

import sys

  try:
    some things

  except ZeroDivisionError:
    print sys.exc_info()

  //multipurpose exception, like the ending else
  except:
    print some other things

want to have different error catching for different errors

you can put your whole program in a try but thats not polite
  try to focus the errorhandler on a specific area

keepGoing = True
while keepGoing:

while keepGoing:

  if x == 5:
    print "Thats a nice number"
  elif x > 5:
    print "I would prefer a 5"
  else:
    print "What else could it be"
