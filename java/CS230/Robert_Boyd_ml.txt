;;Input the numbers to be multiplied at the bottom in the a: and b: labels
;;ensure that there is no space after the colon 
;;input should look like this a:X (x is your Integer)

;;Checks if a is negative if so we jump to Aneg label

		Anegativecheck:	LOD a
					JMN Aneg
					JMP Bnegativecheck

;;Checks is b is negative is so we jump to Bneg label

		Bnegativecheck:	LOD b
					JMN Bneg
					JMP cycle

;;Multiplication Cycle. Nothing to see here.

		cycle:			LOD product
					ADD a
					STO product
					LOD b
					DEC
					STO b

					JMZ negativetimeA
					JMP cycle

;; Checks to see if the negative number indicator is tripped and if so it
;; makes the product negative

		negativetimeA:			LOD isAneg
						JMZ negativetimeB
						LOD product
						SUB product
						SUB product
						STO product

		negativetimeB:			LOD isBneg
						JMZ quit
						LOD product
						SUB product
						SUB product
						STO product


		quit: 			LOD product
					HLT
		

;;When negative numbers are encountered they are sent here and made positive
;;Also updates the label is?Neg to display a 1 

Aneg:		LOD a
		SUB a
		SUB a
		STO a
		LOD isAneg
		INC	
		STO isAneg	
		JMP Bnegativecheck

Bneg:		LOD b
		SUB b
		SUB b
		STO b
		LOD isBneg
		INC
		STO isBneg
		cycle

;;aNeg and Bneg should be 0 if both numbers are positive ints if not they will be 1

a:5
b:4

product:0
isAneg:0
isBneg:0
